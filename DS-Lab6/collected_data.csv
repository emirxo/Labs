A framework for understanding data science,"The objective of this research is to provide a framework with which the data
science community can understand, define, and develop data science as a field
of inquiry. The framework is based on the classical reference framework
(axiology, ontology, epistemology, methodology) used for 200 years to define
knowledge discovery paradigms and disciplines in the humanities, sciences,
algorithms, and now data science. I augmented it for automated problem-solving
with (methods, technology, community). The resulting data science reference
framework is used to define the data science knowledge discovery paradigm in
terms of the philosophy of data science addressed in previous papers and the
data science problem-solving paradigm, i.e., the data science method, and the
data science problem-solving workflow, both addressed in this paper. The
framework is a much called for unifying framework for data science as it
contains the components required to define data science. For insights to better
understand data science, this paper uses the framework to define the emerging,
often enigmatic, data science problem-solving paradigm and workflow, and to
compare them with their well-understood scientific counterparts, scientific
problem-solving paradigm and workflow.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00776v1
Defining Data Science,"Data science is gaining more and more and widespread attention, but no
consensus viewpoint on what data science is has emerged. As a new science, its
objects of study and scientific issues should not be covered by established
sciences. Data in cyberspace have formed what we call datanature. In the
present paper, data science is defined as the science of exploring datanature.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05039v1
Data Science in Perspective,"Data and Science has stood out in the generation of results, whether in the
projects of the scientific domain or business domain. CERN Project, Scientific
Institutes, companies like Walmart, Google, Apple, among others, need data to
present their results and make predictions in the competitive data world. Data
and Science are words that together culminated in a globally recognized term
called Data Science. Data Science is in its initial phase, possibly being part
of formal sciences and also being presented as part of applied sciences,
capable of generating value and supporting decision making. Data Science
considers science and, consequently, the scientific method to promote decision
making through data intelligence. In many cases, the application of the method
(or part of it) is considered in Data Science projects in scientific domain
(social sciences, bioinformatics, geospatial projects) or business domain
(finance, logistic, retail), among others. In this sense, this article
addresses the perspectives of Data Science as a multidisciplinary area,
considering science and the scientific method, and its formal structure which
integrate Statistics, Computer Science, and Business Science, also taking into
account Artificial Intelligence, emphasizing Machine Learning, among others.
The article also deals with the perspective of applied Data Science, since Data
Science is used for generating value through scientific and business projects.
Data Science persona is also discussed in the article, concerning the education
of Data Science professionals and its corresponding profiles, since its
projection changes the field of data in the world.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05852v1
Data Science: A Comprehensive Overview,"The twenty-first century has ushered in the age of big data and data economy,
in which data DNA, which carries important knowledge, insights and potential,
has become an intrinsic constituent of all data-based organisms. An appropriate
understanding of data DNA and its organisms relies on the new field of data
science and its keystone, analytics. Although it is widely debated whether big
data is only hype and buzz, and data science is still in a very early phase,
significant challenges and opportunities are emerging or have been inspired by
the research, innovation, business, profession, and education of data science.
This paper provides a comprehensive survey and tutorial of the fundamental
aspects of data science: the evolution from data analysis to data science, the
data science concepts, a big picture of the era of data science, the major
challenges and directions in data innovation, the nature of data analytics, new
industrialization and service opportunities in the data economy, the profession
and competency of data education, and the future of data science. This article
is the first in the field to draw a comprehensive big picture, in addition to
offering rich observations, lessons and thinking about data science and
analytics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03606v1
Ten Research Challenge Areas in Data Science,"Although data science builds on knowledge from computer science, mathematics,
statistics, and other disciplines, data science is a unique field with many
mysteries to unlock: challenging scientific questions and pressing questions of
societal importance. This article starts with meta-questions about data science
as a discipline and then elaborates on ten ideas for the basis of a research
agenda for data science.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05658v1
"The Art and Practice of Data Science Pipelines: A Comprehensive Study of Data Science Pipelines In Theory, In-The-Small, and In-The-Large","Increasingly larger number of software systems today are including data
science components for descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. The
collection of data science stages from acquisition, to cleaning/curation, to
modeling, and so on are referred to as data science pipelines. To facilitate
research and practice on data science pipelines, it is essential to understand
their nature. What are the typical stages of a data science pipeline? How are
they connected? Do the pipelines differ in the theoretical representations and
that in the practice? Today we do not fully understand these architectural
characteristics of data science pipelines. In this work, we present a
three-pronged comprehensive study to answer this for the state-of-the-art, data
science in-the-small, and data science in-the-large. Our study analyzes three
datasets: a collection of 71 proposals for data science pipelines and related
concepts in theory, a collection of over 105 implementations of curated data
science pipelines from Kaggle competitions to understand data science
in-the-small, and a collection of 21 mature data science projects from GitHub
to understand data science in-the-large. Our study has led to three
representations of data science pipelines that capture the essence of our
subjects in theory, in-the-small, and in-the-large.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01590v3
Embracing Data Science,"Statistics is running the risk of appearing irrelevant to today's
undergraduate students. Today's undergraduate students are familiar with data
science projects and they judge statistics against what they have seen.
Statistics, especially at the introductory level, should take inspiration from
data science so that the discipline is not seen as somehow lesser than data
science. This article provides a brief overview of data science, outlines ideas
for how introductory courses could take inspiration from data science, and
provides a reference to materials for developing stand-alone data science
courses.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00858v1
Defining data science: a new field of inquiry,"Data science is not a science. It is a research paradigm. Its power, scope,
and scale will surpass science, our most powerful research paradigm, to enable
knowledge discovery and change our world. We have yet to understand and define
it, vital to realizing its potential and managing its risks. Modern data
science is in its infancy. Emerging slowly since 1962 and rapidly since 2000,
it is a fundamentally new field of inquiry, one of the most active, powerful,
and rapidly evolving 21st century innovations. Due to its value, power, and
applicability, it is emerging in over 40 disciplines, hundreds of research
areas, and thousands of applications. Millions of data science publications
contain myriad definitions of data science and data science problem solving.
Due to its infancy, many definitions are independent, application specific,
mutually incomplete, redundant, or inconsistent, hence so is data science. This
research addresses this data science multiple definitions challenge by
proposing the development of coherent, unified definition based on a data
science reference framework using a data science journal for the data science
community to achieve such a definition. This paper provides candidate
definitions for essential data science artifacts that are required to discuss
such a definition. They are based on the classical research paradigm concept
consisting of a philosophy of data science, the data science problem solving
paradigm, and the six component data science reference framework (axiology,
ontology, epistemology, methodology, methods, technology) that is a frequently
called for unifying framework with which to define, unify, and evolve data
science. It presents challenges for defining data science, solution approaches,
i.e., means for defining data science, and their requirements and benefits as
the basis of a comprehensive solution.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16177v3
Undergraduate data science education: Who has the microphone and what are they saying?,"The presence of data science has been profound in the scientific community in
almost every discipline. An important part of the data science education
expansion has been at the undergraduate level. We conducted a systematic
literature review to (1) specify current evidence and knowledge gaps in
undergraduate data science education and (2) inform policymakers and data
science educators/practitioners about the present status of data science
education research. The majority of the publications in data science education
that met our search criteria were available open-access. Our results indicate
that data science education research lacks empirical data and reproducibility.
Not all disciplines contribute equally to the field of data science education.
Computer science and data science as a separate field emerge as the leading
contributors to the literature. In contrast, fields such as statistics,
mathematics, as well as other fields closely related to data science exhibit a
limited presence in studies. We recommend that federal agencies and researchers
1) invest in empirical data science education research; 2) diversify research
efforts to enrich the spectrum of types of studies; 3) encourage scholars in
key data science fields that are currently underrepresented in the literature
to contribute more to research and publications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03387v1
Why Data Science Projects Fail,"Data Science is a modern Data Intelligence practice, which is the core of
many businesses and helps businesses build smart strategies around to deal with
businesses challenges more efficiently. Data Science practice also helps in
automating business processes using the algorithm, and it has several other
benefits, which also deliver in a non-profitable framework. In regards to data
science, three key components primarily influence the effective outcome of a
data science project. Those are 1.Availability of Data 2.Algorithm 3.Processing

Citizen Science in the European Open Science Cloud,"The European Open Science Cloud aims to make all data Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable and Reusable. By far the largest community of users of the
European Open Science Cloud is the science-inclined public. These users need a
more curated experience of open science than subject specialists, but
nevertheless make very substantial research contributions in open science,
especially in crowdsourced data mining, i.e. citizen science. This short,
non-technical invited review presents applications of citizen science in the
European Open Science Cloud, with a particular focus on astrophysics and
astroparticle physics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06896v1
Building Data Science Capabilities into University Data Warehouse to Predict Graduation,"The discipline of data science emerged to combine statistical methods with
computing. At Aalto University, Finland, we have taken first steps to bring
educational data science as a part of daily operations of Management
Information Services. This required changes in IT environment: we enhanced data
warehouse infrastructure with a data science lab, where we can read predictive
model training data from data warehouse database and use the created predictive
models in database queries. We then conducted a data science pilot with an
objective to predict students' graduation probability and time-to-degree with
student registry data. Further ethical and legal considerations are needed
before using predictions in daily operations of the university.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05401v1

Data Science in Biomedicine,"We highlight the role of Data Science in Biomedicine. Our manuscript goes
from the general to the particular, presenting a global definition of Data
Science and showing the trend for this discipline together with the terms of
cloud computing and big data. In addition, since Data Science is mostly related
to areas like economy or business, we describe its importance in biomedicine.

discussions in this article.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16964v1
Navigating Diverse Data Science Learning: Critical Reflections Towards Future Practice,"Data Science is currently a popular field of science attracting expertise
from very diverse backgrounds. Current learning practices need to acknowledge
this and adapt to it. This paper summarises some experiences relating to such

some learned lessons that are of relevance to others teaching Data Science.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03750v1
ChatGPT for Teaching and Learning: An Experience from Data Science Education,"ChatGPT, an implementation and application of large language models, has
gained significant popularity since its initial release. Researchers have been
exploring ways to harness the practical benefits of ChatGPT in real-world
scenarios. Educational researchers have investigated its potential in various
subjects, e.g., programming, mathematics, finance, clinical decision support,
etc. However, there has been limited attention given to its application in data
science education. This paper aims to bridge that gap by utilizing ChatGPT in a
data science course, gathering perspectives from students, and presenting our
experiences and feedback on using ChatGPT for teaching and learning in data
science education. The findings not only distinguish data science education
from other disciplines but also uncover new opportunities and challenges
associated with incorporating ChatGPT into the data science curriculum.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16650v1
"Trust in Data Science: Collaboration, Translation, and Accountability in Corporate Data Science Projects","The trustworthiness of data science systems in applied and real-world
settings emerges from the resolution of specific tensions through situated,
pragmatic, and ongoing forms of work. Drawing on research in CSCW, critical
data studies, and history and sociology of science, and six months of immersive
ethnographic fieldwork with a corporate data science team, we describe four
common tensions in applied data science work: (un)equivocal numbers,
(counter)intuitive knowledge, (in)credible data, and (in)scrutable models. We
show how organizational actors establish and re-negotiate trust under messy and
uncertain analytic conditions through practices of skepticism, assessment, and
credibility. Highlighting the collaborative and heterogeneous nature of
real-world data science, we show how the management of trust in applied
corporate data science settings depends not only on pre-processing and
quantification, but also on negotiation and translation. We conclude by
discussing the implications of our findings for data science research and
practice, both within and beyond CSCW.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03389v1
"Opinionated practices for teaching reproducibility: motivation, guided instruction and practice","In the data science courses at the University of British Columbia, we define
data science as the study, development and practice of reproducible and
auditable processes to obtain insight from data. While reproducibility is core
to our definition, most data science learners enter the field with other
aspects of data science in mind, for example predictive modelling, which is
often one of the most interesting topic to novices. This fact, along with the
highly technical nature of the industry standard reproducibility tools
currently employed in data science, present out-of-the gate challenges in
teaching reproducibility in the data science classroom. Put simply, students
are not as intrinsically motivated to learn this topic, and it is not an easy
one for them to learn. What can a data science educator do? Over several
iterations of teaching courses focused on reproducible data science tools and
workflows, we have found that providing extra motivation, guided instruction
and lots of practice are key to effectively teaching this challenging, yet
important subject. Here we present examples of how we deeply motivate,
effectively guide and provide ample practice opportunities to data science
students to effectively engage them in learning about this topic.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13656v2
"How sustainable is ""common"" data science in terms of power consumption?","Continuous developments in data science have brought forth an exponential
increase in complexity of machine learning models. Additionally, data
scientists have become ubiquitous in the private market, academic environments
and even as a hobby. All of these trends are on a steady rise, and are
associated with an increase in power consumption and associated carbon
footprint. The increasing carbon footprint of large-scale advanced data science
has already received attention, but the latter trend has not. This work aims to
estimate the contribution of the increasingly popular ""common"" data science to
the global carbon footprint. To this end, the power consumption of several
typical tasks in the aforementioned common data science tasks will be measured
and compared to: large-scale ""advanced"" data science, common computer-related
tasks, and everyday non-computer related tasks. This is done by converting the
measurements to the equivalent unit of ""km driven by car"". Our main findings
are: ""common"" data science consumes $2.57$ more power than regular computer
usage, but less than some common everyday power-consuming tasks such as
lighting or heating; large-scale data science consumes substantially more power
than common data science.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01934v1
How Do Data Science Workers Communicate Intermediate Results?,"Data science workers increasingly collaborate on large-scale projects before
communicating insights to a broader audience in the form of visualization.
While prior work has modeled how data science teams, oftentimes with distinct
roles and work processes, communicate knowledge to outside stakeholders, we
have little knowledge of how data science workers communicate intermediately
before delivering the final products. In this work, we contribute a nuanced
description of the intermediate communication process within data science
teams. By analyzing interview data with 8 self-identified data science workers,
we characterized the data science intermediate communication process with four
factors, including the types of audience, communication goals, shared
artifacts, and mode of communication. We also identified overarching challenges
in the current communication process. We also discussed design implications
that might inform better tools that facilitate intermediate communication
within data science teams.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03305v1
"A data science axiology: the nature, value, and risks of data science","Data science is not a science. It is a research paradigm with an unfathomed
scope, scale, complexity, and power for knowledge discovery that is not
otherwise possible and can be beyond human reasoning. It is changing our world
practically and profoundly already widely deployed in tens of thousands of
applications in every discipline in an AI Arms Race that, due to its
inscrutability, can lead to unfathomed risks. This paper presents an axiology
of data science, its purpose, nature, importance, risks, and value for problem
solving, by exploring and evaluating its remarkable, definitive features. As
data science is in its infancy, this initial, speculative axiology is intended
to aid in understanding and defining data science to recognize its potential
benefits, risks, and open research challenges. AI based data science is
inherently about uncertainty that may be more realistic than our preference for
the certainty of science. Data science will have impacts far beyond knowledge
discovery and will take us into new ways of understanding the world.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10460v2
Challenges and Opportunities of Teaching Data Visualization Together with Data Science,"With the increasing amount of data globally, analyzing and visualizing data
are becoming essential skills across various professions. It is important to
equip university students with these essential data skills. To learn, design,
and develop data visualization, students need knowledge of programming and data
science topics. Many university programs lack dedicated data science courses
for undergraduate students, making it important to introduce these concepts
through integrated courses. However, combining data science and data
visualization into one course can be challenging due to the time constraints
and the heavy load of learning. In this paper, we discuss the development of
teaching data science and data visualization together in one course and share
the results of the post-course evaluation survey. From the survey's results, we
identified four challenges, including difficulty in learning multiple tools and
diverse data science topics, varying proficiency levels with tools and
libraries, and selecting and cleaning datasets. We also distilled five
opportunities for developing a successful data science and visualization
course. These opportunities include clarifying the course structure,
emphasizing visualization literacy early in the course, updating the course
content according to student needs, using large real-world datasets, learning
from industry professionals, and promoting collaboration among students.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05969v1
Philosophy within Data Science Ethics Courses,"There is wide agreement that ethical considerations are a valuable aspect of
a data science curriculum, and to that end, many data science programs offer
courses in data science ethics. There are not always, however, explicit
connections between data science ethics and the centuries-old work on ethics
within the discipline of philosophy. Here, we present a framework for bringing
together key data science practices with ethics topics. The ethics topics were
collated from sixteen data science ethics courses with public-facing syllabi
and reading lists. We encourage individuals who are teaching data science
ethics to engage with the philosophical literature and its connection to
current data science practices, which are rife with potentially morally charged
decision points.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02444v3
The 4+1 Model of Data Science,"Data Science is a complex and evolving field, but most agree that it can be
defined as a combination of expertise drawn from three broad areascomputer
science and technology, math and statistics, and domain knowledge -- with the
purpose of extracting knowledge and value from data. Beyond this, the field is
often defined as a series of practical activities ranging from the cleaning and
wrangling of data, to its analysis and use to infer models, to the visual and
rhetorical representation of results to stakeholders and decision-makers. This
essay proposes a model of data science that goes beyond laundry-list
definitions to get at the specific nature of data science and help distinguish
it from adjacent fields such as computer science and statistics. We define data
science as an interdisciplinary field comprising four broad areas of expertise:
value, design, systems, and analytics. A fifth area, practice, integrates the
other four in specific contexts of domain knowledge. We call this the 4+1 model
of data science. Together, these areas belong to every data science project,
even if they are often unconnected and siloed in the academy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07631v1
"Data-driven materials science: status, challenges and perspectives","Data-driven science is heralded as a new paradigm in materials science. In
this field, data is the new resource, and knowledge is extracted from materials
data sets that are too big or complex for traditional human reasoning -
typically with the intent to discover new or improved materials or materials
phenomena. Multiple factors, including the open science movement, national
funding, and progress in information technology, have fueled its development.
Such related tools as materials databases, machine learning, and
high-throughput methods are now established as parts of the materials research
toolset. However, there are a variety of challenges that impede progress in
data-driven materials science: data veracity, integration of experimental and
computational data, data longevity, standardization, and the gap between
industrial interests and academic efforts. In this perspective article, we
discuss the historical development and current state of data-driven materials
science, building from the early evolution of open science to the rapid
expansion of materials data infrastructures. We also review key successes and
challenges so far, providing a perspective on the future development of the
field.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05644v2
"How do Data Science Workers Collaborate? Roles, Workflows, and Tools","Today, the prominence of data science within organizations has given rise to
teams of data science workers collaborating on extracting insights from data,
as opposed to individual data scientists working alone. However, we still lack
a deep understanding of how data science workers collaborate in practice. In
this work, we conducted an online survey with 183 participants who work in
various aspects of data science. We focused on their reported interactions with
each other (e.g., managers with engineers) and with different tools (e.g.,
Jupyter Notebook). We found that data science teams are extremely collaborative
and work with a variety of stakeholders and tools during the six common steps
of a data science workflow (e.g., clean data and train model). We also found
that the collaborative practices workers employ, such as documentation, vary
according to the kinds of tools they use. Based on these findings, we discuss
design implications for supporting data science team collaborations and future
research directions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06684v3
Data science transfer pathways from associate's to bachelor's programs,"A substantial fraction of students who complete their college education at a
public university in the United States begin their journey at one of the 935
public two-year colleges. While the number of four-year colleges offering
bachelor's degrees in data science continues to increase, data science
instruction at many two-year colleges lags behind. A major impediment is the
relative paucity of introductory data science courses that serve multiple
student audiences and can easily transfer. In addition, the lack of pre-defined
transfer pathways (or articulation agreements) for data science creates a
growing disconnect that leaves students who want to study data science at a
disadvantage. We describe opportunities and barriers to data science transfer
pathways. Five points of curricular friction merit attention: 1) a first course
in data science, 2) a second course in data science, 3) a course in scientific
computing, data science workflow, and/or reproducible computing, 4) lab
sciences, and 5) navigating communication, ethics, and application domain
requirements in the context of general education and liberal arts course
mappings. We catalog existing transfer pathways, efforts to align curricula
across institutions, obstacles to overcome with minimally-disruptive solutions,
and approaches to foster these pathways. Improvements in these areas are
critically important to ensure that a broad and diverse set of students are
able to engage and succeed in undergraduate data science programs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12528v2
Data Quality Awareness: A Journey from Traditional Data Management to Data Science Systems,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed various fields, significantly
impacting our daily lives. A major factor in AI success is high-quality data.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the evolution of data
quality (DQ) awareness from traditional data management systems to modern
data-driven AI systems, which are integral to data science. We synthesize the
existing literature, highlighting the quality challenges and techniques that
have evolved from traditional data management to data science including big
data and ML fields. As data science systems support a wide range of activities,
our focus in this paper lies specifically in the analytics aspect driven by
machine learning. We use the cause-effect connection between the quality
challenges of ML and those of big data to allow a more thorough understanding
of emerging DQ challenges and the related quality awareness techniques in data
science systems. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to
provide a review of DQ awareness spanning traditional and emergent data science
systems. We hope that readers will find this journey through the evolution of
data quality awareness insightful and valuable.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03007v1
Data science is science's second chance to get causal inference right: A classification of data science tasks,"Causal inference from observational data is the goal of many data analyses in
the health and social sciences. However, academic statistics has often frowned
upon data analyses with a causal objective. The introduction of the term ""data
science"" provides a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in such a
way that it naturally accommodates causal inference from observational data.
Like others before, we organize the scientific contributions of data science
into three classes of tasks: Description, prediction, and counterfactual
prediction (which includes causal inference). An explicit classification of
data science tasks is necessary to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics
required to successfully accomplish each task. We argue that a failure to
adequately describe the role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data
analysis is a source of widespread misunderstandings about data science.
Specifically, causal analyses typically require not only good data and
algorithms, but also domain expert knowledge. We discuss the implications for
the use of data science to guide decision-making in the real world and to train
data scientists.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10846v6
A large-scale comparative analysis of Coding Standard conformance in Open-Source Data Science projects,"Background: Meeting the growing industry demand for Data Science requires
cross-disciplinary teams that can translate machine learning research into
production-ready code. Software engineering teams value adherence to coding
standards as an indication of code readability, maintainability, and developer
expertise. However, there are no large-scale empirical studies of coding
standards focused specifically on Data Science projects. Aims: This study
investigates the extent to which Data Science projects follow code standards.
In particular, which standards are followed, which are ignored, and how does
this differ to traditional software projects? Method: We compare a corpus of
1048 Open-Source Data Science projects to a reference group of 1099 non-Data
Science projects with a similar level of quality and maturity. Results: Data
Science projects suffer from a significantly higher rate of functions that use
an excessive numbers of parameters and local variables. Data Science projects
also follow different variable naming conventions to non-Data Science projects.
Conclusions: The differences indicate that Data Science codebases are distinct
from traditional software codebases and do not follow traditional software
engineering conventions. Our conjecture is that this may be because traditional
software engineering conventions are inappropriate in the context of Data
Science projects.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08978v2
The Future of Data Science Education,"The definition of Data Science is a hotly debated topic. For many, the
definition is a simple shortcut to Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning.
However, there is far more depth and nuance to the field of Data Science than a
simple shortcut can provide. The School of Data Science at the University of
Virginia has developed a novel model for the definition of Data Science. This
model is based on identifying a unified understanding of the data work done
across all areas of Data Science. It represents a generational leap forward in
how we understand and teach Data Science. In this paper we will present the
core features of the model and explain how it unifies various concepts going
far beyond the analytics component of AI. From this foundation we will present
our Undergraduate Major curriculum in Data Science and demonstrate how it
prepares students to be well-rounded Data Science team members and leaders. The
paper will conclude with an in-depth overview of the Foundations of Data
Science course designed to introduce students to the field while also
implementing proven STEM oriented pedagogical methods. These include, for
example, specifications grading, active learning lectures, guest lectures from
industry experts and weekly gamification labs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11824v1
A Review into Data Science and Its Approaches in Mechanical Engineering,"Nowadays it is inevitable to use intelligent systems to improve the
performance and optimization of different components of devices or factories.
Furthermore, it's so essential to have appropriate predictions to make better
decisions in businesses, medical studies, and engineering studies, etc. One of
the newest and most widely used of these methods is a field called Data Science

their careers. This article briefly introduced data science and reviewed its
methods, especially it's usages in mechanical engineering and challenges and
ways of developing data science in mechanical engineering. In the introduction,
different definitions of data science and its background in technology
reviewed. In the following, data science methodology which is the process that
a data scientist needs to do in its works been discussed. Further, some
researches in the mechanical engineering area that used data science methods in
their studies, are reviewed. Eventually, it has been discussed according to the

data science in mechanical engineering researches and projects.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15358v1
Science Fiction Media Representations of Exoplanets: Portrayals of Changing Astronomical Discoveries,"Interest in science fiction's (SF's) potential science communication use is
hindered by concerns about SF misrepresenting science. This study addresses
these concerns by asking how SF media reflects scientific findings in exoplanet
science. A database of SF exoplanets was analysed using a Bayesian network to
find interconnected interactions between planetary characterisation features
and literary data. Results reveal SF exoplanets designed after the discovery of
real exoplanets are less Earth-like, providing statistical evidence that SF
incorporates rapidly-evolving science. Understanding SF's portrayal of science
is crucial for its potential use in science communication.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00684v1
Teaching Visual Accessibility in Introductory Data Science Classes with Multi-Modal Data Representations,"Although there are various ways to represent data patterns and models,
visualization has been primarily taught in many data science courses for its
efficiency. Such vision-dependent output may cause critical barriers against
those who are blind and visually impaired and people with learning
disabilities. We argue that instructors need to teach multiple data
representation methods so that all students can produce data products that are
more accessible. In this paper, we argue that accessibility should be taught as
early as the introductory course as part of the data science curriculum so that
regardless of whether learners major in data science or not, they can have
foundational exposure to accessibility. As data science educators who teach
accessibility as part of our lower-division courses in two different
institutions, we share specific examples that can be utilized by other data
science instructors.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02565v1

The Difficulties of Addressing Interdisciplinary Challenges at the Foundations of Data Science,"The National Science Foundation's Transdisciplinary Research in Principles of
Data Science (TRIPODS) program aims to integrate three areas central to the
foundations of data by uniting the statistics, mathematics, and theoretical
computer science research communities. The program aims to provide a model for
funding cross-cutting research and facilitating interactions among the three
disciplines. Challenges associated with orchestrating fruitful interactions are
described.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03033v1
Data Makes Better Data Scientists,"With the goal of identifying common practices in data science projects, this
paper proposes a framework for logging and understanding incremental code
executions in Jupyter notebooks. This framework aims to allow reasoning about
how insights are generated in data science and extract key observations into
best data science practices in the wild. In this paper, we show an early
prototype of this framework and ran an experiment to log a machine learning
project for 25 undergraduate students.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17690v1
Square Kilometre Array Science Data Challenge 1,"The Square Kilometre Array (SKA, https://skatelescope.org) will be the
world's largest radio telescope. SKA Science Data Challenges will be regularly
issued to the community as part of the science preparatory activities. The
purpose of these challenges is to inform the development of the data reduction
workflows, to allow the science community to get familiar with the standard
products the SKA will deliver, and optimise their analyses to extract science
from them. These challenges may consist of real data from currently operating
radio facilities or of simulated SKA data. The purpose of this document is to
provide information on how the SKA Science data challenge #1 (SDC1) has been
produced and to set the challenge for the community. For more information on
how to take part in the challenge and to download the data see

NOMAD: The FAIR Concept for Big-Data-Driven Materials Science,"Data is a crucial raw material of this century, and the amount of data that
has been created in materials science in recent years and is being created
every new day is immense. Without a proper infrastructure that allows for
collecting and sharing data (including the original data), the envisioned
success of materials science and, in particular, Big-Data driven materials
science will be hampered. For the field of computational materials science, the
NOMAD (Novel Materials Discovery) Center of Excellence (CoE) has changed the
scientific culture towards a comprehensive and FAIR data sharing, opening new
avenues for mining Big-Data of materials science. Novel data-analytics concepts
and tools turn data into knowledge and help the prediction of new materials or
the identification of new properties of already known materials.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05039v1
Data Science and Ebola,"Data Science---Today, everybody and everything produces data. People produce
large amounts of data in social networks and in commercial transactions.
Medical, corporate, and government databases continue to grow. Sensors continue
to get cheaper and are increasingly connected, creating an Internet of Things,
and generating even more data. In every discipline, large, diverse, and rich
data sets are emerging, from astrophysics, to the life sciences, to the
behavioral sciences, to finance and commerce, to the humanities and to the
arts. In every discipline people want to organize, analyze, optimize and
understand their data to answer questions and to deepen insights. The science
that is transforming this ocean of data into a sea of knowledge is called data
science. This lecture will discuss how data science has changed the way in
which one of the most visible challenges to public health is handled, the 2014
Ebola outbreak in West Africa.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02878v1
Data Science: Challenges and Directions,"While data science has emerged as a contentious new scientific field,
enormous debates and discussions have been made on it why we need data science
and what makes it as a science. In reviewing hundreds of pieces of literature
which include data science in their titles, we find that the majority of the
discussions essentially concern statistics, data mining, machine learning, big
data, or broadly data analytics, and only a limited number of new data-driven
challenges and directions have been explored. In this paper, we explore the
intrinsic challenges and directions inspired by comprehensively exploring the
complexities and intelligence embedded in data science problems. We focus on
the research and innovation challenges inspired by the nature of data science
problems as complex systems, and the methodologies for handling such systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16966v1
Computational Skills by Stealth in Secondary School Data Science,"The unprecedented growth in the availability of data of all types and
qualities and the emergence of the field of data science has provided an
impetus to finally realizing the implementation of the full breadth of the
Nolan and Temple Lang proposed integration of computing concepts into
statistics curricula at all levels in statistics and new data science programs
and courses. Moreover, data science, implemented carefully, opens accessible
pathways to stem for students for whom neither mathematics nor computer science
are natural affinities, and who would traditionally be excluded. We discuss a
proposal for the stealth development of computational skills in students' first
exposure to data science through careful, scaffolded exposure to computation
and its power. The intent of this approach is to support students, regardless
of interest and self-efficacy in coding, in becoming data-driven learners, who
are capable of asking complex questions about the world around them, and then
answering those questions through the use of data-driven inquiry. This
discussion is presented in the context of the International Data Science in
Schools Project which recently published computer science and statistics
consensus curriculum frameworks for a two-year secondary school data science
program, designed to make data science accessible to all.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07017v1
A survey study of success factors in data science projects,"In recent years, the data science community has pursued excellence and made
significant research efforts to develop advanced analytics, focusing on solving
technical problems at the expense of organizational and socio-technical
challenges. According to previous surveys on the state of data science project
management, there is a significant gap between technical and organizational
processes. In this article we present new empirical data from a survey to 237
data science professionals on the use of project management methodologies for
data science. We provide additional profiling of the survey respondents' roles
and their priorities when executing data science projects. Based on this survey
study, the main findings are: (1) Agile data science lifecycle is the most
widely used framework, but only 25% of the survey participants state to follow
a data science project methodology. (2) The most important success factors are
precisely describing stakeholders' needs, communicating the results to
end-users, and team collaboration and coordination. (3) Professionals who
adhere to a project methodology place greater emphasis on the project's
potential risks and pitfalls, version control, the deployment pipeline to
production, and data security and privacy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06310v1
Categorical Data Integration for Computational Science,"Categorical Query Language is an open-source query and data integration
scripting language that can be applied to common challenges in the field of
computational science. We discuss how the structure-preserving nature of CQL
data migrations protect those who publicly share data from the
misinterpretation of their data. Likewise, this feature of CQL migrations
allows those who draw from public data sources to be sure only data which meets
their specification will actually be transferred. We argue some open problems
in the field of data sharing in computational science are addressable by
working within this paradigm of functorial data migration. We demonstrate these
tools by integrating data from the Open Quantum Materials Database with some
alternative materials databases.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10579v1
Toward a Knowledge Discovery Framework for Data Science Job Market in the United States,"The growth of the data science field requires better tools to understand such
a fast-paced growing domain. Moreover, individuals from different backgrounds
became interested in following a career as data scientists. Therefore,
providing a quantitative guide for individuals and organizations to understand
the skills required in the job market would be crucial. This paper introduces a
framework to analyze the job market for data science-related jobs within the US
while providing an interface to access insights in this market. The proposed
framework includes three sub-modules allowing continuous data collection,
information extraction, and a web-based dashboard visualization to investigate
the spatial and temporal distribution of data science-related jobs and skills.
The result of this work shows important skills for the main branches of data
science jobs and attempts to provide a skill-based definition of these data
science branches. The current version of this application is deployed on the
web and allows individuals and institutes to investigate skills required for
data science positions through the industry lens.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11077v2
Perspective on Data Science,"The field of data science currently enjoys a broad definition that includes a
wide array of activities which borrow from many other established fields of
study. Having such a vague characterization of a field in the early stages
might be natural, but over time maintaining such a broad definition becomes
unwieldy and impedes progress. In particular, the teaching of data science is
hampered by the seeming need to cover many different points of interest. Data
scientists must ultimately identify the core of the field by determining what
makes the field unique and what it means to develop new knowledge in data
science. In this review we attempt to distill some core ideas from data science
by focusing on the iterative process of data analysis and develop some
generalizations from past experience. Generalizations of this nature could form
the basis of a theory of data science and would serve to unify and scale the
teaching of data science to large audiences.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06324v1
Facilitating team-based data science: lessons learned from the DSC-WAV project,"While coursework provides undergraduate data science students with some
relevant analytic skills, many are not given the rich experiences with data and
computing they need to be successful in the workplace. Additionally, students
often have limited exposure to team-based data science and the principles and
tools of collaboration that are encountered outside of school. In this paper,
we describe the DSC-WAV program, an NSF-funded data science workforce
development project in which teams of undergraduate sophomores and juniors work
with a local non-profit organization on a data-focused problem. To help
students develop a sense of agency and improve confidence in their technical
and non-technical data science skills, the project promoted a team-based
approach to data science, adopting several processes and tools intended to
facilitate this collaboration. Evidence from the project evaluation, including
participant survey and interview data, is presented to document the degree to
which the project was successful in engaging students in team-based data
science, and how the project changed the students' perceptions of their
technical and non-technical skills. We also examine opportunities for
improvement and offer insight to other data science educators who may want to
implement a similar team-based approach to data science projects at their own
institutions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11209v4
Data science and Machine learning in the Clouds: A Perspective for the Future,"As we are fast approaching the beginning of a paradigm shift in the field of
science, Data driven science (the so called fourth science paradigm) is going
to be the driving force in research and innovation. From medicine to
biodiversity and astronomy to geology, all these terms are somehow going to be
affected by this paradigm shift. The huge amount of data to be processed under
this new paradigm will be a major concern in the future and one will strongly
require cloud based services in all the aspects of these computations (from
storage to compute and other services). Another aspect will be energy
consumption and performance of prediction jobs and tasks within such a
scientific paradigm which will change the way one sees computation. Data
science has heavily impacted or rather triggered the emergence of Machine
Learning, Signal/Image/Video processing related algorithms, Artificial
intelligence, Robotics, health informatics, geoinformatics, and many more such
areas of interest. Hence, we envisage an era where Data science can deliver its
promises with the help of the existing cloud based platforms and services with
the addition of new services. In this article, we discuss about data driven
science and Machine learning and how they are going to be linked through cloud
based services in the future. It also discusses the rise of paradigms like
approximate computing, quantum computing and many more in recent times and
their applicability in big data processing, data science, analytics, prediction
and machine learning in the cloud environments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01661v1
